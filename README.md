# team-profile-generator

## This application allows you to keep track of your team of employees by adding a manager, engineer(s), and intern(s) to your team profile page.  

### Using Node in your command line, you will receive a number of different prompts; you may add a manager (including their name, employee id number, email, and office number) and then choose to "Add an Enginner," "Add an Intern," or "Finsh."  

### If you choose to add an engineer to your team, you will be prompted for their name, employee id number, email address, and GitHub profile name.  If you choose to add an intern, you will be prompted for their name, employee id number, email address, and the school they attend.  

### After each additional employee, you will again be prompted to "Add an Enginner," "Add an Intern," or "Finsh."  These prompts will repeat until you select "Finish."  Once the employees have been added via Node, they will be displayed with their relevant information on the generated HTML.
