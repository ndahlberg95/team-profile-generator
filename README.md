# team-profile-generator

## This application allows you to keep track of your team of employees by adding a manager, engineer(s), and intern(s) to your team profile page.  Using Node in your command line, you will receive a number of different prompts; you may add a manager (including their name, employee id number, email, and office number) and then choose to "Add an Enginner," "Add an Intern," or "Finsh."  These prompts will repeat after each additional employee until you select "Finish."  Once the employees have been added via Node, they will be displayed with their relevant information on the generated HTML.
